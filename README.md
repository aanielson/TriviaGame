# TriviaGame
Second Javascript homework. 
What the project does
    This is a trivia game that begins when you select "start." A timer runs as you attempt to answer 8 true/false questions about Pokemon Trivia. When the timer runs out, the display changes to show you how many you naswered coorectly and incorrectly, as well as how many you left unanswered. It allows you to reset and try again, but it does not tell you which you got right or wrong.
Why the project is useful
    This is a fun game to test your knowledge of Pokemon! It utilizes html, css, javascript, and jquery. It was our first assignment to incorporate a timer.
Who maintains and contributes to the project
    This was an independent project rather than a group project.
